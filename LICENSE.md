# H4KU.com Personal Source License (LPSL-1.0)

Copyright © 2025 HAKU. All rights reserved.

## Purpose

This license lets you read and learn from the H4KU.com source while keeping the live
experience and artwork exclusive to the author. The code is shared for inspiration,
not for cloning or redistribution.

## Permitted Use

1. You may view, fork, and run the repository for personal evaluation on your own devices.
2. You may quote short excerpts (≤ 50 contiguous lines) in articles or talks when you credit
   `https://github.com/0xH4KU/H4KU.com`.
3. You may reference the architectural ideas in your own projects, provided you implement
   them independently.

## Restrictions

You **may not**:

1. Deploy, host, or publish H4KU.com (or a substantially similar derivative) on the internet,
   whether free or commercial.
2. Copy or redistribute the artwork, copy, or JSON content contained in this repository.
3. Re-license, sublicense, or sell the code, assets, or any derivative experience.
4. Remove attribution, change copyright notices, or misrepresent H4KU.com as your own work.
5. Use H4KU.com in any commercial product, service, or SaaS offering without a separate
   written agreement from HAKU.

## Contributions

If you submit code, issues, or pull requests, you grant HAKU an irrevocable right to use,
modify, and distribute that contribution as part of H4KU.com under this license. You remain
the original author of your contribution.

## Termination

Violation of these terms automatically terminates your rights. HAKU may revoke this license
for any reason by providing written notice (for example, via repository issues or email).

## Disclaimer

H4KU.com is provided "as is," without warranties of any kind. HAKU is not liable for any
damages arising from viewing, running, or relying on this source.

## Integrity Notice

Open-source builds now include an `_integrity` checksum (see `src/content/_aggregated.json`) and a `[verified]` footer indicator so viewers can distinguish official deployments from modified forks. Do not remove or falsify this indicator when sharing demos; doing so is considered misrepresentation under the restrictions above.

For uses outside the permissions listed here (educational demos, talks, publications,
custom licensing), email `0x@H4KU.com`.
